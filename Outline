-- make a mockup for the frontend and the pages and the functionalities that you want (2)
-- re-inforce the backend and work on every functionality, don't focus on the UI (3)
-- once you are sure that everything is working as you want it to be, make a kick-ass UI (4)

    //   let popular_movies = []
    //    for(let i = 0; i < result.length; i++){
    //         let movie = {}
    //         movie.title = result[i].original_title
    //         movie.image = result[i].poster_path
    //         // titles[i] = result[i].original_title
    //         // images[i] = result[i].poster_path 
    //         popular_movies[i] = movie;
    //    }
    // //    let data = [titles, images]
